                The Apple website shows a lot of white space around each of their objects. I feel that they use the
                principle of white space very well to show emphesis on their products that they are trying to display.

                <br>
                Microsoft's main website that they have does a good job with the principle of proximity. When they want
                to show that items are related, then they are close by eachother. When looking at their document app
                software, they are not right next to eachother but they are close to show that they are all related.

                I chose Riot Game's website because I'm a fan of their game, but also when I saw it I noticed that they
                used contrast to make their website pop. There are dark colors with a mix of stark bright colors for the
                contrast to show emphesis on where they want you to click.
